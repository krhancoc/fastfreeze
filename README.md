## Introduction

_FastFreeze_ enables checkpoint/restore for applications running in Linux
containers. It uploads/downloads checkpoint images to AWS S3 and Google Storage,
provides a friendly CLI to job systems, and does not require elevated privileges
(such as CAP_SYS_ADMIN).

The primary use-case of FastFreeze is to make HPC applications more resilient to
failure. This makes Google's preemptible VM and Amazon Spot VM offerings more
attractive to HPC applications. We are exploring other use-cases such as JVM
memory ballooning, warm-boots, and jupyter integration.

FastFreeze is powered by the [CRIU](https://criu.org/) engine.

### Usage in a nutshell

1. **Start** the application via FastFreeze with the `run` command in an empty
   Linux container (e.g., Kuebrnetes, Docker).

   ```
   fastfreeze run --image-url s3://fastfreeze-images/job.ff -- app.sh [args...]
   ```

2. **Checkpoint** the application with the `checkpoint` command.
   This persists the state of the application into the AWS S3 location we
   provided at step 1. The application is terminated upon successful checkpoint.

   ```
   fastfreeze checkpoint
   ```

3. **Restore** the application by running is the same command as step 1,
   possibly on another machine. The `run` command checks if the image is
   present. If so, it restores the application. If not, it runs the application
   from scratch. This makes FastFreeze ideal to integrate with existing job
   systems that retry commands until job succeed.


   ```
   # same as step 1
   ```

## Features

FastFreeze includes the following high-level features:

* **Unprivileged**: FastFreeze does not need privileges like CAP_SYS_ADMIN to
  operate. We use a modified version of CRIU to accomplish this. In addition,
  we use [set_ns_last_pid](https://github.com/twosigma/set_ns_last_pid) to
  to control PIDs by cycling through PIDs at a rate of 100,000/s by
  essentially doing a fork bomb, until we reach the PID that we desire.

* **Fast**: FastFreeze uses
  [criu-image-streamer](https://github.com/checkpoint-restore/criu-image-streamer)
  to perform fast checkpointings at speed of up to 15GB/s, given enough CPU and
  network bandwidth. This makes Google's preemptible VM and Amazon Spot VM
  offerings more attractive. FastFreeze can checkpoint and evacuate even large
  processes within the tight eviction deadlines (~30secs).

* **Low overhead**: FastFreeze needs less than 100MB of memory to perform a
  checkpoint or a restore. This memory headroom must be reserved in the
  container in addition to what the application uses. Note that the standard S3
  and GCS uploaders (`aws s3` and `gsutil`) tend to use a lot of memory (500MB)
  due to the fact that they are written in Python and use large buffers. In the
  future, we will open-source our custom uploaders that can be used with
  FastFreeze.

* **Compression**: Checkpoint images can be compressed on the fly with lz4 or
  zstd. Setting the `--cpu-budget` option when checkpointing provides ways to
  control the compression algorithm. Compression is parallelized for optimal
  performance. In the future, we plan to add encryption to images.

* **CPUID virtualization**: FastFreeze enables CPU virtualization with
  [libvirtcpuid](https://github.com/twosigma/libvirtcpuid). This enables the
  migration of applications within a heterogeneous datacenter. For example,
  starting an application on a machine that support transactional memory can
  be migrated to a host that does not.

* **Time virtualization**: FastFreeze implements time virtualization in
  userspace to offset the `CLOCK_MONOTONIC` when migrating to other machines
  with [libvirttime](https://github.com/twosigma/libvirttime).
  This feature is crucial for Java programs.

* **File system**: FastFreeze checkpoints and restore the files used by the
  application such as logs, and other temporary files. These files are not
  automatically detected, but rather, the user must specify the paths (files or
  directories) that must be preserved via the `--preserve-path` option.

* **Metrics**: FastFreeze can be configured to emit metrics to an external
  service to collect checkpoint/restore stats. This is helpful to track the SLA
  of FastFreeze.

### Non-root limitations

FastFreeze does not use privileged operations. This creates the following drawbacks:

* FastFreeze must run within a Linux container (e.g., Kubernetes, Docker). This
  guarantees that there are no PID conflicts. The container image must remain
  unchanged when migrating an application to a different container.

* The network connections are dropped upon restore. We rely on the application
  to be tolerant to network failures and reconnect to needed services.

* The `/proc/self/exe` symlink is not restored and will point to the criu binary.
  When using gdb to attach to a restored program, one must pass the real
  executable path to gdb as such: `gdb -p PID /path/to/exe`.

* Controlling PIDs without CAP_SYS_ADMIN can be slow if
  `/proc/sys/kernel/pid_max` is high. We recommend setting a value lower than
  100,000.

* Memory mapped files that have been deleted are not supported.

* As FastFreeze assumes operating within a Linux container, it does not
  checkpoint/restore cgroups, seccomp, and user capabilities. We also do not
  support System V IPC. Create an [issue](issues/new) if you need IPC support.

### Supported Applications

FastFreeze supports most Linux applications, with some restrictions:

* GPUs and external devices are not supported.

* Applications that rely on host-dependent environment variables may have issues
  when migrated to a new host. Avoid relying on such variables, or caching
  host-dependent information.

* Applications that use ptrace cannot be checkpointed (e.g., running under
  `strace`).

* Due to CPUID virtualization, Only x86 64-bits application running with GNU
  libc are supported. In practice, that means no musl libc, so no alpine docker.

* Secure binaries are not supported. For example, an application that runs a
  script with `sudo` is a problem.

* On some systems, apparmor can be upset beause we relocate the system ld.so at
  `/var/fastfreeze/run` which may not be in the white-listed path of executable
  mmap files. This is not an issue in practice.

* FastFreeze only supports a single application execution at a time within a
  container. To run two instances of FastFreeze, one must use two separate
  containers.

### Non-features

* Checkpoint images are not managed by FastFreeze. Pruning old images is not in
  the scope of FastFreeze.

## Usage

### Installation

FastFreeze is distributed in a self-contained 4MB package that needs to be
extracted in `/opt/fastfreeze`.

The following shows an example of the installation of FastFreeze in a debian
Docker image.

```dockerfile
FROM debian:9

RUN apt-get update
RUN apt-get install -y curl xz-utils libcap2-bin

RUN set -ex; \
  curl -SL https://github.com/twosigma/fastfreeze/releases/download/1.0.0/fastfreeze-1.0.0.tar.xz | \
    tar xJf - -C /opt; \
  ln -s /opt/fastfreeze/fastfreeze_wrapper.sh /usr/local/bin/fastfreeze; \
  fastfreeze install; \
  setcap cap_sys_ptrace+eip /opt/fastfreeze/criu
```

The `install` command overrides the system loader `/lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2`,
and creates `/var/fastfreeze` where files such as logs are kept. Note that the
replacing the system loader is useful even when not doing CPUID virtualization.
It allows the inject the time virtualiation library into all processes.

The `setcap` command adds the `CAP_SYS_PTRACE` capability to CRIU.
This may or may not be needed depending of the yama configuration
`/proc/sys/kernel/yama/ptrace_scope` (see `man ptrace(2)`), or if Kubernetes is
configured with `CAP_SYS_PTRACE` as ambiant capability.

### Tutorial

You may try out FastFreeze with the following:

```bash
# First, save the previously suggested Dockerfile from the Installation section
# in the current directory

# Then, build the docker image
$ docker build . -t fastfreeze

# 1) Run the application for the first time
$ docker run \
  --rm -it \
  --user nobody \
  --cap-add=cap_sys_ptrace \
  --name ff \
  --mount type=bind,source=/tmp,target=/tmp \
  fastfreeze:latest \
  fastfreeze run --image-url file:/tmp/ff-test -- \
    bash -c 'for i in $(seq 100); do echo $i; sleep 1; done'

# The application is running. We should see on the terminal:
#   [ff.run] (0.001s) Time is Sat, 15 Aug 2020 05:21:41 +0000
#   [ff.run] (0.001s) Host is 44f6ce3d5b4a
#   [ff.run] (0.001s) Invocation ID is Jg9qyV
#   [ff.run] (0.012s) Fetching image manifest for file:/tmp/ff-test
#   [ff.run] (0.014s) Image manifest not found, running application from scratch
#   [ff.run] (0.030s) Application is ready, started from scratch
#   1
#   2
#   3
#   4

# 2) In another terminal, we invoke the checkpoint command
$ docker exec ff fastfreeze checkpoint

# We should see:
#   [ff.checkpoint] (0.000s) Time is Sat, 15 Aug 2020 05:21:54 +0000
#   [ff.checkpoint] (0.000s) Host is 44f6ce3d5b4a
#   [ff.checkpoint] (0.000s) Invocation ID is aaNN7y
#   [ff.checkpoint] (0.000s) Checkpointing application to file:/tmp/ff-test (num_shards=4 compressor=Lz4 prefix=aaNN7y)
#   tar: Removing leading `/' from member names
#   [ff.checkpoint] (0.014s) Uncompressed image size is 1 MiB, rate: 132 MiB/s
#   [ff.checkpoint] (0.017s) Checkpoint to file:/tmp/ff-test complete. Took 0.0s

# The first terminal should show:
#   [ff.run] (13.012s) Exiting with exit_code=137: Application caught fatal signal SIGKILL
#
# The application is now checkpointed. We can inspect the image in /tmp/ff-test
# We see that the image is split into 4 different pieces. This is to increase performance.
$ ls -lh /tmp/ff-test

#   total 116K
#   -rw-r--r-- 1 nobody nogroup 22K Aug 15 05:21 aaNN7y-1.ffs
#   -rw-r--r-- 1 nobody nogroup 19K Aug 15 05:21 aaNN7y-2.ffs
#   -rw-r--r-- 1 nobody nogroup 42K Aug 15 05:21 aaNN7y-3.ffs
#   -rw-r--r-- 1 nobody nogroup 23K Aug 15 05:21 aaNN7y-4.ffs
#   -rw-r--r-- 1 nobody nogroup  82 Aug 15 05:21 manifest.json

# 3) We restore the application by running the same command as in 1)
$ docker run \
  --rm -it \
  --user nobody \
  --cap-add=cap_sys_ptrace \
  --name ff \
  --mount type=bind,source=/tmp,target=/tmp \
  fastfreeze:latest \
  fastfreeze run --image-url file:/tmp/ff-test -- \
    bash -c 'for i in $(seq 100); do echo $i; sleep 1; done'

# We see in the terminal;
#  [ff.run] (0.000s) Time is Sat, 15 Aug 2020 05:29:53 +0000
#  [ff.run] (0.000s) Host is 4259e670e092
#  [ff.run] (0.000s) Invocation ID is V0qRYI
#  [ff.run] (0.015s) Fetching image manifest for file:/tmp/ff-test
#  [ff.run] (0.017s) Restoring application
#  [ff.run] (0.126s) Uncompressed image size is 1 MiB, rate: 134 MiB/s
#  [ff.run] (0.157s) Application is ready, restore took 0.2s
#  5
#  6
#  7
#  8
```

In this example, we used the local file system to store the checkpoint image,
but in practice one would use something like AWS S3, or GCS.
